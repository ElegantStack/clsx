# clsx

This is a VS Code plugin forked from [ClassNameify](https://github.com/epadz/ClassNameify) that converts string class names to use the [clsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx) library

To use it, simply right click a className prop on a react or preact component and click `Convert to clsx` in the context menu
